# Python Neural Network

## Introduction
This is project is my attempt at a personal introduction to neural networks. I will be following along with '[Make Your Own Neural Network](https://makeyourownneuralnetwork.blogspot.com/)' by Tariq Rashid. The goal of this project is to design and build a neural network to identify and categorize handwritten numbers in Python.

# Usage  
After cloning the repository, run setup.py to install the needed dependencies. This should only be needed once.

It can be run by using `python main.py`. It currently uses the images found in mnist_dataset/images for training and testing.
