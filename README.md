# Python Neural Network

## Introduction
This is project is my attempt at a personal introduction to neural networks. I will be following along with '[Make Your Own Neural Network](https://makeyourownneuralnetwork.blogspot.com/)' by Tariq Rashid. The goal of this project is to design and build a neural network to identify and categorize handwritten numbers in Python.

# Usage  
After cloning the repository, run `python setup.py` to install the needed dependencies and unzip the datasets. This should only be needed once.

It can be run by using `python main.py`.  

Once the network has been trained, the user can provide 3 options.  
  - Enter a number, 0-9, to test the corresponding image from mnist_dataset/images/test  
  - Enter 'all' to test against all 10 images in mnist_dataset/images/test  
  - Enter 'q' to quit the program
